                            ========================

Running
=======
In order to run the Shell Client, export the shell client jar file (see
instructions in the README file) and run it using:
  java -jar /tmp/shell.jar

Commands
========
* login <server-address> <username> - Logs into the server, starting a session.
      <server-address> - The base-url of the server. For example:
          http://192.168.1.162:8080/Server/chess/
      <username> - The username to use when logging in. The username is used only
          as a display name.
* seek - Seeks an opponent. May be used only after login. When the seek is
      matched, the game information is printed, mentioning the username of the
      player playing white and the player playing black.
      Once playing a game, the client listens for game events. Any new events
      will be printed.

      matched, and before the game ended.
      <from> - The square from which the piece moves. For example: e2.
      <to> - The square to which the piece moves. For example: e4.
      Castling is considered a king move. For example, white's king-side castle
      is done using 'move e1 g1'.

      the game ended.
